# fizzBuzz challenge

Create a function called fizzBuzz. This function should take in number as a parameter. The function should do the following:

If the number is divisible by 3 and 5, then return "FizzBuzz"
If the number is divisible by 3, then return "Fizz"
If the number is divisible by 5, then return "Buzz"
Else just return the number
Write a set of tests that pass in various values to the FizzBuzz function and ensure that the function meets the above requirements. Make sure that you test all different "types" of inputs that the function may receive.

The Jasmine framework is used and the files fizzBuzzSpec.js and fizzBuzz.js will be run using the boilerplate in index.html.

The test will be done on calling the function on "30", "9", "20", "17" and a string "fifteen".
